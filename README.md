# Brizen Sports

This repository is a personal project developed to help sports bettors to have a better decision-making process and a higher profit.

# Motivation

Since I was a kid I was amazed by sports. Football, Basketball, American Football, Ice Hockey, and many more.

I've tried to become a football player, but I think I'm no Neymar, nor even I'm a Harry Maguire.

Even though I couldn't make a living from the pitches, I may have created a way to earn a penny or two from the pitches.

# Build Status

Brizen is running through terminal command and is in its first version.

Brizen collects data from a specific website, stores the data in a MongoDB database, and retrieve the calculated data giving the user a decision call.

# Tech / Framework used

Brizen is built using Python 3, Selenium library for webscraping, and MongoDB as non-relational database.

Brizen uses chromedriver to run its webscraper and the executable must be in the same directory.

# How to use?

Just download the files (.py files, chromedriver) to the chosen directory and install selenium, MongoDB, and pymongo.
